# What is this Plugin For?

This plugin addresses the need for dynamic snippets in Roblox Studio. It allows you to quickly create your own snippets with parameters, so you can reuse code snippets while easily customizing their values.

## Why Use It?

Dynamic snippets let you:
- Reuse code snippets multiple times.
- Change their values as needed without rewriting code.
- Enjoy an easy-to-use and configurable tool that saves time during development.

## Contributing

If you wish to contribute:
- **Please use StyLua** to format your code.
- Use the provided `.stylua.toml` file for your settings.
- **DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING ELSE IN THE PROJECT OTHER THAN THE PLUGIN CODE.**
